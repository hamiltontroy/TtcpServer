TtcpServer:: class
this class will have a simple task

TtcpServer server; // just makes an object, nothing happens

server.waitForAClient(1111); // will wait for a client on a specific port number,
// then returns the file descriptor for the socket that connects.
// is a blocking call.

example{

TtcpServer server;

for(;;)
    sayHi(server.waitForAClient(1111));

this example makes a server instance, then everytime a client connects to the
server on port number 1111 and the fildes is returned, the sayHi function can
do something to that fildes.
}

Behavior:

The server will listen on its specified port number, then return the int
file descriptor of the client connection.

If the port number is changed, such as calling waitForAClient with a different
argument value, then the prior file descriptor is closed, and any connection
using that file descriptor is terminated. Then the server effectively
switches to operate using the new port number.

If the argument is 0, then the socket will be cleaned and -1 will be returned.
